# üçΩÔ∏è Zomato Database Management System ‚Äî SQL Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Zomato-like Food Delivery System** using **SQL**. It includes:
- Database setup with relational tables
- CRUD operations
- Advanced SQL queries for analysis
- Reporting and insights  

**Database:** `zomato`  
**Level:** Intermediate ‚Üí Advanced  

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Create and manage database schema for customers, restaurants, riders, orders, and deliveries  
- Perform CRUD operations and enforce relationships with primary/foreign keys  
- Write analytical SQL queries to answer real-world business questions  
- Showcase SQL skills for **data analysis, joins, window functions, ranking, and aggregation**
